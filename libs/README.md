# Libs

This sub dir is just a collection of needed java libraries to develope an own simulation with *MASON* and the `mason.jar` itself. The packages may not be up to date, keep that in mind in case of any errors.

Just make your IDE use the folder as a library folder (you may move the folder into you own project) or make sure the jars are included into your own `*.jar` when using maven or something else.
