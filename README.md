# Mason Supermarket Simulation
This project contains an [experiments](experiments/README.md) folder with basic implementations of *MASON* within a java project. In addition, there is a [Supermarket Simulation](SupermarketSimulation/README.md) for consumers waiting at a checkstand. 

## Prerequisites
For both sub projects there are prerequisites to met:
### To run the examples
1. Install the latest [Java SDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
2. Install [Java 3D](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-java-client-419417.html#java3d-1.5.1-oth-JPR) for the 3D examples. 
3. Download [Mason](http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/) and follow the instructions given at this page.

### To develop an own simulation application
To develop with *MASON* you have to satisfy the prerequistes of the previous paragraph and just follow the instructions of our [libs](libs/README.md) folder. If you want to install the required additional libraries yourself you find this steps usefull (in brackets are the linux packages):
1. Install *JFreeChart* (libjfreechart-java).
2. Install *JCommon* (java-common).
3. Install *iText* (libitext-java).
3. Install [JMF](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-java-client-419417.html#7372-jmf-2.1.1e-oth-JPR) (or add the 'cross-platform' jmf.jar file to your 
   CLASSPATH or to your 'mason' directory)
